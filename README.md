# Boids

Boids is a work in progress Haskell implementation of boids [1].
Boids attempt to model groups of natural actors, like fish and birds,
in a realistic seeming way. The package provides a small DSL for
defining different boid behaviours as well as functionality for
rendering flocks of boids as GIF files.
